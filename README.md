# Student Manager (JavaFX)

A simple JavaFX desktop application for managing student records.  
The application focuses on **adding and removing students** using a clean, form-based user interface.

## Features
- Add students through input fields
- Remove students either by:
  - Selecting a student from the TableView, or
  - Entering the student’s name manually
- TableView-based student list
- Basic input validation for required fields
- Keyboard navigation (Enter key moves between fields)
- Clear user feedback through on-screen messages

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JavaFX

## Key Concepts Implemented
- JavaFX layouts (VBox, HBox, GridPane, etc.)
- Event handling using `setOnAction`
- TableView and column configuration
- ObservableList for dynamic data updates
- Input validation and focus management
- Basic UI styling (fonts, spacing, alignment)

## What I Learned
- How different JavaFX layout panes work together to structure a UI
- Managing user input and validation in JavaFX
- Using TableView and ObservableList to display and update data dynamically
- Handling keyboard events to improve user experience
- Applying fonts and spacing to create a cleaner, more readable interface

## Future Improvements
- Edit/update existing student records
- Support additional student attributes
- Persist data using files or a database
- Improve UI styling using external CSS
